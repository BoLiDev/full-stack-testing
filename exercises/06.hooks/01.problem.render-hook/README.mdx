# Render Hook

👨‍💼 We've got ourselves a hook we want to test! The `useDoubleCheck`
in <InlineFile file="app/utils/misc.tsx" />.

I want you to try both `renderHook` and `TestComponent` for this exercise.
Sometimes you just have to do it both ways and see which you dislike the least
(and then choose the other one of course 😅).

Let's start with `renderHook`. Here's a reminder of how to use that API:

```tsx filename=use-counter.test.tsx
import { renderHook, act } from '@testing-library/react'
import { expect, test } from 'vitest'
import { useCounter } from './use-counter'

test('increments and decrements', () => {
	const { result } = renderHook(() => useCounter(0))

	expect(result.current.count).toBe(0)
	act(() => result.current.increment())
	expect(result.current.count).toBe(1)
	act(() => result.current.decrement())
	expect(result.current.count).toBe(0)
})
```

Remember the warning before:

<callout-danger>
	Be sure to always reference values off of `result.current`. Do not destructure
	values off of `result.current` and then reference them. This will lead you to
	referencing stale values and your tests won't work reliably.
