# Test Component

👨‍💼 Let's try the Test Component approach. In this, you create a component that
uses the hook the way you would expect it to be used, then you render and test
that. Here's our example from earlier:

```tsx filename=use-counter.test.tsx
/**
 * @vitest-environment jsdom
 */
import { renderHook, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import userEventDefault from '@testing-library/user-event'
import { useState } from 'react'
import { expect, test } from 'vitest'
import { useCounter } from './use-counter'

// https://github.com/testing-library/user-event/issues/1146
const userEvent = userEventDefault.default ?? userEventDefault

test('increments and decrements', async () => {
	function TestComponent() {
		const { count, increment, decrement } = useCounter(0)
		return (
			<div>
				<output>{count}</output>
				<button onClick={increment}>+</button>
				<button onClick={decrement}>-</button>
			</div>
		)
	}

	render(<TestComponent />)

	expect(screen.getByRole('status').textContent).toBe(0)
	await userEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: '+' }))
	expect(screen.getByRole('status').textContent).toBe(1)
	await userEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: '-' }))
	expect(result.current.count).toBe(0)
})
```

In this example, you don't have to worry about `act` or `result.current`. You
interact with the test component just like any other component you're testing.

The key point is that you render everything you need to know about into the DOM
so it can be selected and asserted. You can still pass mock functions and things
as props as needed, but that's not always necessary.

So, let's add another test that uses a custom `TestComponent`!
