# Test Component

👨‍💼 I don't know about you, but I really could go either way on this one. So
Kellie 🧝‍♂️ and I flipped a coin and we chose the Test Component approach. We feel
it resembles the way the hook should be used more closely.

If you'd like to add more tests for the component, feel free! 🧝‍♂️ Kellie is going
to remove the `renderHook` tests and add more tests using the Test Component.

🧝‍♂️ I'll also be starting another test for us to work on in the next exercise.
