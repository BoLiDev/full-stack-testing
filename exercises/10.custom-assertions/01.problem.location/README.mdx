# Custom Matchers

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/web-application-testing/custom-assertions/custom-matchers-for-assertions" />

👨‍💼 Let's make our assertions better! We'll start with one called
`toHaveRedirect` which should replace our `assertRedirect` util. There are
really two checks going on here:

1. The response status code is between 300 and 400
2. The `response.headers.get('location')` is what we expect

So we should have three kinds of error messages:

- `Expected response to redirect but got no redirect`
- `Expected response status to be >= 300 && < 400 but got {status}`
- `Expected response to redirect to {expected} but got {actual}`

And then if you have some extra time, you can try to support
`expect(response).not.toHaveRedirect()` which adds an interesting element to all
of this (can make the error message code look funny if you don't care about
ternaries 🫢).

Here's a reminder of what this API is like:

```tsx
import {
	expect,
	type Assertion,
	type AsymmetricMatchersContaining,
} from 'vitest'

expect.extend({
	toBeLoggedIn(userName: string) {
		const link = screen.queryByRole('link', { name: userName })
		const button = screen.queryByRole('button', { name: /logout/i })

		return {
			pass: Boolean(link && button),
			message: () => {
				return `Expected ${
					this.isNot ? 'not ' : ''
				}to be logged in as ${this.utils.printExpected(userName)}`
			},
		}
	},
})

interface CustomMatchers<R = unknown> {
	toBeLoggedIn(userName: string): R
}

declare module 'vitest' {
	interface Assertion<T = any> extends CustomMatchers<T> {}
	interface AsymmetricMatchersContaining extends CustomMatchers {}
}
```

```sh nonumber
npx vitest auth
```
