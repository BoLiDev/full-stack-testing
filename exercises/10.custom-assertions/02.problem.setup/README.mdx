# Move to Setup

👨‍💼 We want to be able to use these utilities in all our tests. Could you please
move the matcher you just wrote into a new
file called <InlineFile file="tests/setup/custom-matchers.ts" />, then import
it in the <InlineFile file="tests/setup/setup-test-env.ts" /> so it's accessible
in all our tests?

From there we can add more matchers that are specific to our codebase as we
please.

```sh nonumber
npx vitest auth
```
