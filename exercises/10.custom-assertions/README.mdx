# Custom Assertions

You know assertions? I'm talking about this stuff:

```tsx
expect(1 + 1).toBe(2)
```

Well, there are a bunch of great built-in assertions. But sometimes you have
some state that's a little more complex or use-case specific. One solution is
to have a set of assertions that you wrap up in a function:

```tsx
function assertLoggedIn(userName: string) {
	expect(screen.getByRole('link', { name: userName })).toBeTruthy()
	expect(screen.getByRole('button', { name: /logout/i })).toBeTruthy()
}
```

So then you want to use this in multiple tests, you can move it to a separate
file, but then the code frame you get from Vitest will point to the function,
not where it was called.

	Currently, Vitest's sourcemap support is kind of messed up, so the code frame
	for errors is off by a few lines anyway, but still, at least it's in the right
	file!
</callout-warning>

What would be cooler is if you could make your own assertions, which you can do!
Via [the `expect.extend` API](https://vitest.dev/guide/extending-matchers.html).

Here's what that `assertLoggedIn` function would look like as a custom matcher:

```tsx
expect.extend({
	toBeLoggedIn(userName: string) {
		const link = screen.queryByRole('link', { name: userName })
		const button = screen.queryByRole('button', { name: /logout/i })

		return {
			pass: Boolean(link && button),
			message: () => `Expected to be logged in as ${userName}`,
		}
	},
})
```

You can even support negation (`.not`). Just change the message based on
`this.isNot`:

```tsx lines=11-13
expect.extend({
	toBeLoggedIn(userName: string) {
		const link = screen.queryByRole('link', { name: userName })
		const button = screen.queryByRole('button', { name: /logout/i })

		return {
			// you don't change "pass" based on isNot because vitest will do that for you.
			pass: Boolean(link && button),
			// you only change the message
			message: () => {
				return `Expected ${
					this.isNot ? 'not ' : ''
				}to be logged in as ${userName}`
			},
		}
	},
})
```

And then you can use some utils to color the output as well:

```tsx lines=11
expect.extend({
	toBeLoggedIn(userName: string) {
		const link = screen.queryByRole('link', { name: userName })
		const button = screen.queryByRole('button', { name: /logout/i })

		return {
			pass: Boolean(link && button),
			message: () => {
				return `Expected ${
					this.isNot ? 'not ' : ''
				}to be logged in as ${this.utils.printExpected(userName)}`
			},
		}
	},
})
```

And then you can add this to the TypeScript definitions for `expect` via a
module augmentation:

```tsx lines=23-25,27-30
import {
	expect,
	type Assertion,
	type AsymmetricMatchersContaining,
} from 'vitest'

expect.extend({
	toBeLoggedIn(userName: string) {
		const link = screen.queryByRole('link', { name: userName })
		const button = screen.queryByRole('button', { name: /logout/i })

		return {
			pass: Boolean(link && button),
			message: () => {
				return `Expected ${
					this.isNot ? 'not ' : ''
				}to be logged in as ${this.utils.printExpected(userName)}`
			},
		}
	},
})

interface CustomMatchers<R = unknown> {
	toBeLoggedIn(userName: string): R
}

declare module 'vitest' {
	interface Assertion<T = any> extends CustomMatchers<T> {}
	interface AsymmetricMatchersContaining extends CustomMatchers {}
}
```

There's a lot of power to this API and entire libraries have been developed to
handle common use cases for assertions to make them easier to write and improve
the error messages. For example,
[`jest-dom`](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom) which includes a bunch
of matchers specific to DOM testing.
