# Custom Matchers

👨‍💼 Great! Now let's move this to our setup files so we can use it in all our
tests!

🧝‍♂️ This is just moving code around to different files and stuff, so I'll handle
that for you.

Also, we do currently have the `assertToastSent` and `assertSessionMade`
functions that would be great custom matchers. If you have time and feel up for
it, why don't you try to make custom matchers for those?

I'm going to make them a fair bit more complete as well, so feel free to try
doing that yourself
and <DiffLink app1="playground" app2={1}>compare our solutions</DiffLink>, or
just <DiffLink>check my work</DiffLink>.

Oh, and while I'm at it, I'm going to move a couple things into a new file
called `tests/utils.ts` so it's easier to share things around.
