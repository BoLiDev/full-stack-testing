# Move to Setup

👨‍💼 Great, now we have a good place to put our custom assertions.

🧝‍♂️ We do currently have the `assertToastSent` and `assertSessionMade` functions
that would be great custom matchers. If you have time and feel up for it, why
don't you try to make custom matchers for those.

I'm going to make them a fair bit more complete as well, so feel free to try
doing that yourself
and <DiffLink app1="playground" app2={1}>compare our solutions</DiffLink>, or
just <DiffLink>check my work</DiffLink>.

Oh, and while I'm at it, I'm going to move a couple things into a new file
called `tests/utils.ts` so it's easier to share things around.
