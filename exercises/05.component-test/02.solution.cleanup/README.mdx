👨‍💼 Super! We're all set up to start writing more and more component tests for
those components that have some logic we want to test at a lower level.

🧝‍♂️ We're going to want this to be set up for all our tests, so I'm going to move
this into our <InlineFile file="tests/setup/setup-test-env.ts" /> file.

You can do that yourself if you'd like, or you
can <DiffLink>check out my work here</DiffLink>.
