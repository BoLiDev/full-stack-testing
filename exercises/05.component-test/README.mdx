# Component Testing

When building React components we want to focus on our two users:

1. The end user who's typing in the fields and clicking the buttons
2. The developer user who's rendering our component with props

We want to avoid a "third" user I call the
["Test User"](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/avoid-the-test-user) (which we've
mentioned earlier). So we want to avoid mocking out React and other hooks if we
can help it. We'll do that by using the `render` function from
`@testing-library/react`.

[`@testing-library/react`](https://testing-library.com/react) is the de-facto
standard library for testing React components. It's based on
`@testing-library/dom` which is the basis of testing library implementations for
other frameworks as well.
I'm actually the author of Testing Library! I wrote it when preparing a workshop
like this. It's a set of utilities that allow you to embrace our testing
philosophy:

> The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more
> confidence they can give you. - [@kentcdodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/977018512689455106)

So, if this is your first time using `@testing-library/react`, I recommend
having the documentation open and ready to reference as you go through this
and the next exercise (especially
[the page about queries](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/about)). Much
of it will feel familiar to what we did in the Playwright exercises because
Playwright's queries were inspired by Testing Library's queries ðŸŽ‰.

Here's the simplest example of a test using Testing Library:

```tsx filename=counter.tsx
import * as React from 'react'

export function Counter() {
	const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
	const increment = () => setCount(c => c + 1)
	return <button onClick={increment}>Count: {count}</button>
}
```

```tsx filename=counter.test.tsx
import { expect, test } from 'vitest'
import { Counter } from './counter.tsx'

test('counter increments when clicked', async () => {
	render(<Counter />)
	const button = screen.getByRole('button', { name: /count:/i })
	expect(button.textContent).toBe('Count: 0')
	await userEvent.click(button)
	expect(button.textContent).toBe('Count: 1')
})
```

If you've not used `@testing-library/react` before, I recommend you check out
[the Quick start Example in the docs](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/example-intro)
which should give you a pretty good idea of how to use it effectively.

If you've used Testing Library in the past, you may be interested in reading
[Common mistakes with React Testing Library](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/common-mistakes-with-react-testing-library)
as you may be making them yourself (don't feel bad, they're common ðŸ˜…).

## Simulated DOM

Vitest runs in Node.js, but our components run in a browser. You can actually
[run vitest in the browser](https://vitest.dev/guide/browser.html), but it's
still experimental so we're not going to learn that today, but the
documentation page about it is a good read if you want to understand the
challenges with running in a simulated environment like we do.

What you should know is that in order to simulate a browser environment, we use
a library called [`jsdom`](https://npm.im/jsdom). This library has many known
limitations and differences from real browsers. However, it has the benefit of
being lighter weight than a full browser and therefore it starts up much faster.
So it's well suited for lower level tests like the one's we'll be using it for
today.

That said, we don't want it to be set up by default for all our vitest tests,
so we enable it on a per-test basis using the `@vitest-environment` comment
pragma at the top of our UI test files:

```tsx filename=some-file.test.tsx
/**
 * @vitest-environment jsdom
 */
```

Adding this to a test file tells vitest to initialize `jsdom` in the global
environment before running our test file (so we can safely use `document`, etc.
in our tests).
