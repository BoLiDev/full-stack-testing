# Cleanup

👨‍💼 So, Kellie 🧝‍♂️ put together the rest of the tests for our component, but we've
got a bit of an issue... The tests look fine, but they're not passing. 😱

What's more, if you run the tests individually, they pass! It's only when you
run them together that they fail. 😭

But you know what that means right? It means that we've got a cleanup issue. 🧹
🤦‍♂️

Something you should know about Testing Library's `render` function is that it
wants to help you write code that follows our guiding principle:

> The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more
> confidence they can give you. - [@kentcdodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/977018512689455106)

Well, when our UI components run, they're put into the `document.body`. So
that's what `render` does. The problem is that we never tell it to remove those
elements from the `document.body` when we're done. And `screen` queries are
looking for everything that's rendered on the screen.

So when the first test runs, it sticks stuff in the body, then the next test
runs and sticks more stuff in the body and when `screen` looks for the list
items it finds the old ones too!

Normally, Testing Library actually adds a `afterEach` hook to automatically
cleanup after itself so you don't have to think about this. But we've opted to
not use global test variables and instead those have to be imported, so Testing
Library doesn't do that automatically.

Whether we should just switch to global test variables is debatable, but the
fact is we're not so we need to set up the cleanup ourselves.

Luckily, it's really easy. I'll let Kody guide you through it.
