# Testing Library

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/web-application-testing/component-testing/error-list-component-with-react-testing-library" />

👨‍💼 We have a component that renders a list of error messages. Let's write
one test that verifies this renders properly.

As a reminder, here's an example of a test with `@testing-library/react`:

```tsx
/**
 * @vitest-environment jsdom
 */
import { expect, test } from 'vitest'
import { Counter } from './counter.tsx'

test('counter increments when clicked', async () => {
	await render(<Counter />)
	const button = screen.getByRole('button', { name: /count:/i })
	expect(button.textContent).toBe('Count: 0')
	await userEvent.click(button)
	expect(button.textContent).toBe('Count: 1')
})
```

Let's start with the most basic use case:

- `shows nothing when given an empty list`

## Asserting non-existence

Before you jump in on this one, you should know that Testing Library consists of
a number of utilities that help you find elements in the DOM. The most common
one is `getByRole`, which we've used in the example above. But there are several
others you can use. You can read about them in detail in the
[Testing Library "About Queries" documentation](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/about).

In this exercise, we need to discover how to find elements that _don't_ exist in
the DOM. And since we're looking for multiple elements, we can use the
[`queryByRole`](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/byrole) method. This
method will return an empty array if no elements are found (which is what we're
looking for).

In fact, the only situation where you ever use `queryBy*` or `queryAllBy*`
queries is when you're trying to assert on non-existence of elements. Otherwise,
you should be using the other variants (`get*` or `find*`). For more details,
[refer to the docs](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/about).

## Utilities

Testing Library comes with a few utilities you may find handy when developing
your tests. If you ever want to know what the DOM looks like at any time, you
can run `screen.debug()` and it will log out the current DOM (formatted and with
syntax highlighting).

And if you want to play around with that DOM in a real browser, you
`screen.logTestingPlaygroundURL()` and it will log a URL you can use to open up
the current DOM in [testing-playground.com](https://testing-playground.com).
This can be pretty handy when you're trying to figure out how to write a query
to find an element.
