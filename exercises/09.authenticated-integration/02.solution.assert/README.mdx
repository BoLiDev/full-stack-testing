# Assert Session

👨‍💼 This is great. We've got a nice reusable function to help us make sure we're
logging the user in for certain test scenarios. These assertions can be improved
and we'll do that later. For now, we've still got more authenticated integration
tests to write, but somewhere else...

🧝‍♂️ I'm going to move our `afterEach` cleanup into
the <InlineFile file="tests/setup/setup-test-env.ts" />. The best kind of
cleanup is the kind that happens automatically! Feel free
to <DiffLink>check it out if you want</DiffLink>
