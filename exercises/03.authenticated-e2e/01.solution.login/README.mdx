👨‍💼 Great work!

🧝‍♂️ There's no more new testing learning outcomes here, so I'm going to finish
this test up for you. I'm also going to move what you just made into a new
`login` fixture so that we can use it in other tests.

As usual, if you'd like to finish all that yourself, be my guest! Or, you can
simply <DiffLink>check the diff</DiffLink> if you're just curious.
