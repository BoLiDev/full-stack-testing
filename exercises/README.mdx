# ðŸ§ª Full Stack Testing

## Tips:

- We'll be running a lot of scripts in this workshop. You'll want to make
  certain you're always in the `playground` directory when you do this.
- When you change the playground, the playwright UI sometimes gets confused.
  There's an icon you can click to refresh it, or you
  can <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>r</kbd> to reload.
- If the Playwright UI is saying you don't have any tests, but you definitely do
  it could be that there's a syntax error in your tests. To check, run
  playwright without the `--ui` flag (`npx playwright test`) and it'll give you
  more output.
