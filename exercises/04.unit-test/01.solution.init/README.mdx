# Initial Tests

👨‍💼 Great! Did you notice the issue? In that last test, you've got an error log:

```txt nocopy nonumber nolang
stderr | app/utils/misc.error-message.test.ts > undefined falls back to Unknown
Unable to get error message for error undefined
```

This is useful during debugging, but _very_ annoying when running the tests. We
want to keep our logs as clean as possible to make it easier to spot real
issues. In fact, the log is an important part of the functionality of our util,
so we should probably assert that it's being called.

So it's time for us to learn about spying... 🕵️‍♀️
