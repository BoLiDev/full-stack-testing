# Initial Tests

👨‍💼 Kellie 🧝‍♂️ has already configured vitest for us
in <InlineFile file="vitest.config.ts"/>. Feel free to check
[the vitest docs](https://vitest.dev/config/) if you'd like to learn more about
the configuration options. It's pretty minimal which is nice.

We've got a utility we use in various places throughout the app that would be
nice to have a test for. It's our `getErrorMessage` utility. It's simple and
pure (mostly 😈), so it's a good start for our unit testing journey. Here's how
it's typically used:

```ts
// Error object returns message
getErrorMessage(new Error('Oh no, there was an error'))
// "Oh no, there was an error"

// String returns itself
getErrorMessage('This is another error')
// "This is another error"

// undefined falls back to Unknown
getErrorMessage(undefined)
// "Unknown Error"
```

So let's write some tests for each of these cases. This may not look like much,
but we've got a bit of a curve ball on that last one that'll make this an
especially interesting exercise. Stay tuned!

As a reminder, here's the format of a test in Vitest:

```ts
import { test, expect } from 'vitest'
import { validatePassword } from './validatePassword'

test('returns false for passwords shorter than 8 characters', () => {
	expect(validatePassword('1234567')).toBe(false)
})

// more tests
```

Kody's 🐨 going to take the day off for this one. We think you can write these
tests on your own! If you get stuck, you can
always <DiffLink>check the diff</DiffLink>.
