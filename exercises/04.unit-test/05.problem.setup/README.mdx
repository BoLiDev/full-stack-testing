# Setup Env

Remember our guiding testing principle?

Well, when we run this code, we've got a few things going on in our environment
we should be simulating. Here's some of that setup code:

```ts
import 'dotenv/config'
import 'source-map-support/register.js'
import '~/utils/env.server.ts'

import { installGlobals } from '@remix-run/node'

installGlobals()
```

You'll find similar setup in our <InlineFile file="server/index.ts" />. So we
should have this run in every one of our tests files right?

While you could easily create a file and import it in every test file, it's
better to use
[the vitest `setupFiles` config](https://vitest.dev/config/#setupfiles) because
it's just much more convenient this way.

Additionally, because we want our `console.error` code to be handled the same
in every one our tests, we can move our console error stuff to our setup file
as well.

<InlineFile file="tests/setup/setup-test-env.ts">
	Click here to create the setup file.
</InlineFile>

Put all that stuff from the code sample above in that file and also move the
`consoleError` spy stuff in there (ðŸ’° you'll need to export the `consoleError`)
as well so it can be accessible by any test that wants to clear the mock.

Once you've done that, then go update <InlineFile file="vitest.config.ts" />
with the new `setupFiles` config.

```sh nonumber
npx vitest
```
