# Assert After Each

👨‍💼 So we're silencing `console.error`. That's a bit dangerous because it means
if there's a legit `console.error` we weren't expecting, we wouldn't see it.
The solution to this is pretty simple: we can use `afterEach` to assert that
`console.error` was never called!

But that's a problem for our test where we're _expecting_ it to be called right?

So this means we'll want to
[clear the mock](https://vitest.dev/api/mock.html#mockclear) in any test we're
expecting `console.error` to be called. That way, when we get to `afterEach`, it
won't have any calls to consider.
