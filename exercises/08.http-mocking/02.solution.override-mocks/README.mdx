👨‍💼 Great job! Now we can feel confident that we properly handle errors. This is
important because we don't control third parties and we can't guarantee that
they will always work as expected. We can also use this technique to test
different scenarios, like a different kind of successful response from our usual
kind. The possibilities are endless!

🧝‍♂️ I'm eyeing some of what we've got in here and seeing a great abstraction
opportunity. But I'm not going to do this one for you because you need to learn
something about this.
