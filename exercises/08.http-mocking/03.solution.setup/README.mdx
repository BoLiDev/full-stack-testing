# Setup Functions

👨‍💼 Great job 👍 Now we're going to have Kellie 🧝‍♂️ move the HTTP mocking stuff
into our <InlineFile file="tests/setup/setup-test-env.ts" /> file so we get
the mocks automatically running and reset between every test.

It's just a simple refactor, but you can <DiffLink>check it out</DiffLink> if
you want.
