# Remix Stub

👨‍💼 Our user profile page has some logic for what to display depending on who's
looking at it. If you're looking at your own page, it shows a button for logout
and edit profile. If you're looking at someone else's page, it shows a button to
view their notes.

Go ahead and try with Kody's account: <LinkToApp to="/users/kody" />

Login with Kody: <LinkToApp to="/login" /> (`kody` / `kodylovesyou`) then open
it up again.

We want to test that out, but the problem is those components rely on
`useLoaderData`, so we need to mock that out.

So we're going to render our username route, but we also need to provide a
`loader` so the `useLoaderData` hook has something to return. And we can do
something to make it match the type of the real loader. Here's an example of how
to do that:

```tsx
import { json } from '@remix-run/node'
import { createRemixStub } from '@remix-run/testing'
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import { default as RouteComponent, type loader } from './some-route'

// ...

const App = createRemixStub([
	{
		path: '/some-path',
		element: <RouteComponent />,
		loader(): Awaited<ReturnType<typeof loader>> {
			return json({
				// we have to return the right types or TypeScript will be upset!
			})
		},
	},
])

render(<App initialEntries={['/some-path']} />)

// ...
```

That can help us make sure that our fake version of a loader matches up with the
real one.

🧝‍♂️ I already started this test, but rendering the `<UsernameRoute />` component
doesn't work since we use `useLoaderData` in it which requires a remix stub. So
you're going to need to do that part.

👨‍💼 That should be enough to get you going!

```sh nonumber
npx vitest username
```
