# Multiple Routes

👨‍💼 Our route's loader data isn't the only thing our UsernameRoute depends on.
It also depends on the root route. When we call `useOptionalUser` in the
component, that's referencing the root route's loader data. But we're not
including the root route in our stub.

That works fine for our first test, but if we want to test how the page looks
when the user's logged in, we're going to need to provide the user in the root
route which means we need to provide the root route. And we also need to make
sure the parent-child relationship is set up correctly.

Interestingly, the `createRemixStub` API resembles the react-router API for
[`createBrowserRouter`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/routers/create-browser-router).
Here's what that looks like (from their docs):

```ts
const router = createBrowserRouter([
	{
		path: '/',
		element: <Root />,
		loader: rootLoader,
		children: [
			{
				path: 'team',
				element: <Team />,
				loader: teamLoader,
			},
		],
	},
])
```

That's pretty much exactly what the stub API is as well. So let's add another
test that uses the root route as the parent of the username route so we can
provide the root loader data.

🧝‍♂️ I already got it started for you. It's not working because we don't have the
root route as a parent there. Your job is to add that bit.
