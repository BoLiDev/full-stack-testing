# Global Setup

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/web-application-testing/test-database/optimizing-test-setup" />

👨‍💼 We're doing a lot of repeat work in our tests. Each one is running the
migration script which includes seeding the database. This doesn't take forever,
but it definitely adds quite a bit to our test runs.

What if instead, we just made a "base" database and then copied it for each test
run? This would be a lot faster! We just need to make sure to get our base
database set up before _any_ of the test processes run, so when they are
spawned, the "base" database is ready to be copied.

Luckily for us, Vitest comes with configuration just for this use case and it's
called [`globalSetup`](https://vitest.dev/config/#globalsetup). This is a path
to a file that will be run before any of the tests are run. This is where we'll
set up our "base" database.

Once you have that set up you should be able to run the test. The first time
you'll notice the migration script is run and the base database is created,
but this only happens once for all the tests and after that you'll find the base
database is there and ready to be copied every test run. The tests should run
_much_ faster now!
