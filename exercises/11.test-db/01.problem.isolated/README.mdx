# Create Isolated Database

üë®‚Äçüíº alright, so it makes a lot more sense for us to have isolated databases for
each of our test files since they're so easy to create and delete before each
of our tests. We're going to iterate our way to a good solution. The first step
is just to make sure this is going to work for one test. We'll start with the
test in <InlineFile file="app/routes/_auth+/auth.github.callback.test.ts" />.

To do this, we need to do a couple steps:

1. Set the `DATABASE_URL` to the test database (before anything imports prisma!)
1. Run `prisma migrate reset --force --skip-generate` to reset the database
   before all the tests start. **The `--skip-generate` is important if we don't
   want to mess up our development client**.
1. After each test, we need to delete all the users from the database to
   automatically clean up after ourselves.
1. After all the tests are done, we need to disconnect from the database and
   delete the file.

There's one major sticking point to this: We need to make sure we set
`process.env.DATABASE_URL` before anything imports prisma. Otherwise, prisma
will start up and use our development database.

So what we're going to do is create a special file next to our test that will
manage all of this setup for us, and import that file at the top of the test
file before anything else has a chance to import prisma.

Another issue will be the fact that our test file is inside our `routes`
directory, but we don't want this setup file to be treated as a Remix route.
So if you check out the <InlineFile file="remix.config.js" /> file, you'll
notice that files with a prefix of `__` are ignored. So we'll name our setup
file `__setup.ts` and it won't be treated as a route.

npx vitest auth
