# Read Email

👨‍💼 Great! Those are handy utilities to allow our HTTP mocks to communicate with
our tests. As mentioned earlier, we'll have even better tools for this in the
future built-into MSW ([#1617](https://github.com/mswjs/msw/pull/1617)), but
even when we have that, writing the email to the file system is kind of handy
for us.

🧝‍♂️ I'm going to write another test in `tests/e2e/2fa.test.ts` which will test
our two factor auth process. It'll just go far enough to click "enable 2FA"
because from there we're going to need you to do some magic to make it work. You
can <DiffLink>check the changes</DiffLink> if you want.
