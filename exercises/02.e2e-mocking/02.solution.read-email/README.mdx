# Read Email

👨‍💼 Great! Those are handy utilities to allow our HTTP mocks to communicate with
our tests. As mentioned earlier, we'll have even better tools for this in the
future built-into MSW ([#1617](https://github.com/mswjs/msw/pull/1617)), but
even when we have that, writing the email to the file system is kind of handy
for us.

🧝‍♂️ I'm going to create some utilities out of what you just did to make it easier
for us to create and read fixtures like this in the future. I'll put them in
`tests/mocks/utils.ts`.

Also, I'll write another test in `tests/e2e/2fa.test.ts` which will test our two
factor auth process. It'll just go far enough to click "enable 2FA" because from
there we're going to need you to do some magic to make it work. You can do this
all yourself if you have time, or just <DiffLink>check the changes</DiffLink>
if you want.
