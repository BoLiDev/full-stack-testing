# Insert User

👨‍💼 Great! Our tests are a little less brittle now. But we're still not done.

🧝‍♂️ I'm going to clean things up just a tiny bit by making a utility function.
I'm also going to make it so you don't have to do the
`user.name ?? user.username` thing anymore, because we're creating the user we
know that we'll always have a `name` property. If we ever want to test the
fallback functionality, we'll write a test specifically for that rather than
inconveniencing ourselves everywhere.

Feel free to <DiffLink>check out what I did</DiffLink> or do it yourself if
you'd like.
