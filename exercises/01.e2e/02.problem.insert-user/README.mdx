# Insert User

🦉 Making your tests rely on seed data is sometimes required, but most of the
time doing this will lead to a brittle test suite. For example, what if during
your development, you deleted the seed data we relied on in the test. That could
lead to hours of debugging the broken test for you. Definitely potential for a
"works on their machine why not mine?" scenario.

Instead your tests should be as self-contained as possible, and this means
creating the data you need for your tests to run when they run.

👨‍💼 So in this exercise, we want you to update the test to actually create a user
in the database at the start of the test. This will allow you to search for that
specific user rather than just assuming we'll have a user with a specific
username.

```sh nonumber
npx playwright test --ui
```
