# Cleanup

🦉 Test isolation is no joke. When you don't have test isolation, you can easily
get into a situation where one test is affecting the results of another test.
Running all the tests together can have a different outcome than running them
individually. This is a nightmare to debug.

Test isolation means that each test is independent of the others. Each test
should be able to run in any order, and the results should be the same. In
practice this means you need to have each test handle its own setup and cleanup.

👨‍💼 Go ahead and try running the test a few times. It probably works, but it may
not. This is possible because we're not ensuring the username we create is
unique enough. It's possible a user with the name `sandy_dandy` exists and would
show up in a search result for a user with `sandy_dan` as their username. It's
unlikely you'll run into this, but let's make it even less likely.

Secondly, we're not cleaning up after ourselves. We're creating a user, but
we're not deleting it. This means that if you did run the test a few times, you
should find more and more users in your database. This is annoying at best, and
can break other tests at worst.

So we'd like you to address both of these problems. Kody 🐨 will be
in <InlineFile file="tests/e2e/search.test.ts" /> to help you make this
adjustment.
