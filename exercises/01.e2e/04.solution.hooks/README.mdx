# Test Hooks

👨‍💼 Terrific! We're now in a _much_ better position with this search page. I feel
really confident we won't accidentally push a breaking change to this.

🧝‍♂️ That `insertNewUser` util is great! I'm going to make a new
file at `tests/playwright-utils.ts` to hold it. I'll also add a `waitFor` util
which we'll use in the next exercise. Additionally, I'm going to do a little bit
of work in the `tests/mocks/index.ts` for you to get things ready for the next
exercise.

Finally, I'm going to add a new test in `tests/e2e/onboarding.test.ts` to test
the onboarding flow. I'll add two tests `onboarding with link` and `login as
existing user`. But we're going to have trouble with this because we need some
way to read the email that's been mocked out. That's where you'll come in with
the next exercise.

As usual, <DiffLink app1={0} app2={1} preview>check out my changes</DiffLink>
if you're interested. And if you've got time and want to practice, go ahead and
go for it!
